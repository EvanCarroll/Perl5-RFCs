# Multiple-alias syntax for foreach

## Preamble

    Status:  Draft

## Abstract

Implement the currently illegal syntax `for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }` to act as two-at-a-time iteration over hashes. This approach is not specific to hashes - it generalises to n-at-a-time over any list.

## Motivation

The `each` function is generally discouraged due to implementation details, but is still the most "pretty" and concise way to write such a loop:

    while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) { ... }

An alternative to this would be a syntax to alias multiple items per iteration in a `for` loop.

    for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }

This generalizes as a "bundler" - to alias a number of elements from the list equal to the number of variables specified. Such as:

    for my ($foo, $bar, $baz) (@array) {
        # $foo, $bar, and $baz are the next three elements of @array,
        # or undef if overflowed

## Rationale

The existing syntax to iterate over the keys and values of a hash:

    while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) { ... }

suffers from several problems

* For correctness it assumes that the internal state of the hash being "clean" - to be robust one should reset the iterator first with `keys %hash;` in void context
* It's hard to teach to beginners - to understand what is going on here one needs to know
  - list assignment
  - empty lists are false; non-empty lists are true
  - that the hash holds an internal iterator
* You can't modify the hash inside the loop without confusing the iterator

The proposed syntax solves all of these.

## Specification

## Backwards Compatibility

## Security Implications

## Examples

*FIXME* - are there useful examples that aren't in the Motivation?

## Prototype Implementation

"Here's one I made earlier" applies - we already have one written, so there's no need to duplicate work

## Rejected Ideas

### Permit `undef` in the list of scalars

    for my ($a, undef, $c) (1 .. 9) { ... }

It's a reasonable generalisation of list assignment, where you can assign to undef to mean "ignore this value". I can see that this **might** be useful.  It's also safe syntax to implement (although I didn't try, and I'm not sure how hard it would be).

But it adds considerable runtime complexity. The easiest implementation is if there are exactly *n* scalars, all declared in the `for` loop itself, because this way they occupy adjacent Pad slots. This means that there is only one extra integer to store in the optree, which used both to calculate the *n*-at-a-time **and** the addresses of the target variables.

Adding `undef` to the mix rules out a simple, clear implementation.

### Permit @array or %hash in the list of lexicals

    for my ($key, $value, %rest) (%hash) { ... }
    for my ($first, $second, @rest) (@array) {... }

Syntactically these all "work", and don't violate the assumption that all lexicals are in adjacent Pad slots. But it would add complexity to the runtime. Generalising *1 scalar at a time* to *n at a time* is mostly just adding a C `for` loop around some existing (known working) code.

Implementing these would mean adding code for what is basically a funky way of writing

    { my ($key, $value, %rest) = %hash; ... }
    { my ($first, $second, @rest) = @array; ... }

### Permit `our` as well as `my`

Using `our` instead of `my` works in the grammar. ie we can parse this:

    for our ($foo, $bar, $baz) (@array) {

However, the implementation would be far more complex. Each package variable
would need a pair of GV and RV2GV ops to set it up for aliasing in a lexical,
meaning that we'd need to create a list to feed into ENTERITER, and have it
process that list to set up Pads. This complexity isn't worth it.
