    Title:   Multiple-alias syntax for foreach

# Abstract

Implement the currently illegal syntax `for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }` to act as two-at-a-time iteration over hashes. This approach is not specific to hashes - it generalises to n-at-a-time over any list.

# Motivation

The `each` function is generally discouraged due to implementation details, but is still the most "pretty" and concise way to write such a loop:

    while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) { ... }

An alternative to this would be a syntax to alias multiple items per iteration in a `for` loop.

    for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }

This generalizes as a "bundler" - to alias a number of elements from the list equal to the number of variables specified. Such as:

    for my ($foo, $bar, $baz) (@array) {
        # $foo, $bar, and $baz are the next three elements of @array,
        # or undef if overflowed

# Rationale

The existing syntax to iterate over the keys and values of a hash:

    while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) { ... }

suffers from several problems

* For correctness it assumes that the internal state of the hash being "clean" - to be robust one should reset the iterator first with `keys %hash;` in void context
* It's hard to teach to beginners - to understand what is going on here one needs to know
  - list assignment
  - empty lists are false; non-empty lists are true
  - that the hash holds an internal iterator
* You can't modify the hash inside the loop without confusing the iterator

The proposed syntax solves all of these.

*FIXME* - are there useful examples that aren't in the Motivation/

# Prototype Implementation

"Here's one I made earlier" applies - we already have one written, so there's no need to duplicate work
