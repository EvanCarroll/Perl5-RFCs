This repository is for *Requests For Comments* - proposals to change the Perl language.

Right now, we're [trialling the process](docs/process.md). If you would like to submit a feature request, please [send a short email describing your idea](mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org). You don't need to subscribe to the list to send an idea (or see updates). By keeping all discussion there during the trial, we can see if the process works as hoped, and fix the parts that don't.

Please **don't** submit ideas as *issues* or *PRs* on this repository. (We can disable issues, but not PRs). Please follow the instructions above.

These files describe the process we are trialling

* [motivation.md](docs/motivation.md) - why do we want to do something
* [process.md](docs/process.md) - the initial version of the process
* [template.md](docs/template.md) - the RFC template
* [future.md](docs/future.md) - how we see the process evolving
* [others.md](docs/others.md) - what others do (or did), and what we can learn from them
