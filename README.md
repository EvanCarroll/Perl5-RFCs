This repository is for *Requests For Comments* - proposals to change the Perl language.

The intent is that we will track proposals here from the initial idea to shipped implementation, or record why the idea was rejected. As we are just starting, there are no proposals here yet.

Please **don't** submit ideas as *issues* on this repository. Right now, we're [trialling the process](process.md), and would like ideas mailed to the perl5-porters list. This way we can see if the process works as hoped, and fix the parts that don't.

Currently in this repository there are these files:

* [motivation.md](motivation.md) - why do we want to do something
* [process.md](process.md) - the initial version of the process
* [template.md](template.md) - the RFC template
* [future.md](future.md) - how we see the process evolving
* [others.md](others.md) - what others do (or did), and what we can learn from them
